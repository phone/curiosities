Study of Chris Olah's 2015 backprop article:
https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/

This little doodle just programs the sum and product rules, and allows reverse
backprop on scalar expressions. There's a test for the example in Olah's
article. The interesting stuff is in scalar.hpp.

There's also a simple bump allocator in basic.hpp. Most of its functionality
isn't really exercised here because this particular program is just too small.
